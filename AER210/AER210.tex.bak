\section{Review of Multivariable Calculus}
\subsection{Vectors and Vector-Valued Functions}
\begin{itemize}
\item A vector is a quantity that has magnitude and direction
\item Vectors having the same length and direction are equivalent
\item \underline{Position Vector} - Initial point of the vector at the origin of the coordinate system
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Dot Product}
\begin{itemize}
\item $ \vec{a} \cdot \vec{b} \rightarrow$ scalar product
\end{itemize}
$$ \vec{a} \cdot \vec{b} = a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + a_3b_3 \quad \quad (algebraic)$$
$$ \vec{a} \cdot \vec{b} = |a||b|cos\theta \quad \quad (geometric)$$

\subsection{Cross Product}
\begin{itemize}
\item $\vec{a} \times \vec{b} $ $\rightarrow$ another vector
\item $\vec{c}$ $=$ $\vec{a} \times \vec{b}$ is perpendicular to the plane containing $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$
\end{itemize}
$$
\vec{a}\times \vec{b} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
i&j&k \\
a_1&a_2&a_3 \\
b_1&b_2&b_3 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\quad \quad
(algebraic)
$$
\smallskip
$$
|\vec{c}| = |\vec{a}\times \vec{b}| = |\vec{a}||\vec{b}|sin\theta \quad \quad (geometric)
$$
\begin{itemize}
\item $|\vec{c}|$ is the area of a parallelogram formed by $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Triple Scalar Product}
$$
\vec{a} \cdot (\vec{b} \times \vec{c}) = 
\begin{bmatrix}
a_1&a_2&a_3 \\
b_1&b_2&b_3 \\
c_1&c_2&c_3 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$
\begin{itemize}
\item \underline{Volume of Parallelpiped} = $ |\vec{a}||\vec{b} \times \vec{c}|cos\theta = |\vec{a} \cdot (\vec{b} \times \vec{c})|$
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Vector Functions}
A vector function is a function hose input is a scalar (such as time) and output is a vector.
$$
r(t) = f(t)\vec{i} + g(t)\vec{j} + h(t)\vec{k}
$$
\subsubsection{Derivatives of Vector Functions}
\smallskip
$$
\frac{d\vec{r}(t)}{dt} = \vec{r}'(t) = \lim_{n\to0} \frac{\vec{r}(t+h)-\vec{r}(t)}{h} = f'(t)\vec{i} + g'(t)\vec{j} + h'(t)\vec{k}
$$
\\
At $h=0$, the vector $\frac{\vec{r}(t+h)-\vec{r}(t)}{h}$ approaches a vector that is tangent to the curve at point P.
\subsubsection{Unit Tangent Vector}
$$\vec{T}(\theta) = \frac{\vec{r}'(t)}{|\vec{r}'(t)|}$$
\subsubsection{Arc Length}
$$ S = \int_{a}^{b} |\vec{r}'(t)|dt = \int_{a}^{b} \sqrt{(x'(t))^2 + (y'(t))^2 + (z'(t))^2} dt
$$
\subsubsection{Partial Derivatives}
For functions of multiple variables, select the variable to differentiate with respect to, and treat all others as constants.
$$
f(x, b) = g(x) \quad \rightarrow \quad f_x(x, b) = g'(x)
$$
\medskip
\underline{example:} \\
Set $ f(x, y) = 3x^4y^2$. Find $f_x(x, y)$ and $f_y(x, y)$.
$$ f_x(x, y) = 12x^3y^2 \quad \quad f_y(x, y) = 6x^4y$$
\subsubsection{Higher Order Partial Derivatives}
$$(f_{x})_x = f_{xx} \quad \quad (f_{y})_y = f_{yy} \quad \quad (f_{x})_y = (f_{y})_x  = f_{xy} = f_{xy}$$
\subsubsection{Gradient Vector}
The gradient vector is the rate of change of a function $f(x,y,z)$ composed of its partial derivatives.
$$ \vec{\nabla}f = f_x\vec{i} + f_y\vec{j} + f_z\vec{k} $$
\subsubsection{Chain Rule}
$$ h = f(x,y,z) \quad \rightarrow \quad x=x(t) \quad y = y(t) \quad z = z(t)$$
$$ \frac{df(\vec{r}(t)}{dt} = \langle\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}, \frac{\partial f}{\partial z}\rangle \cdot \langle\frac{dx}{dt}, \frac{dy}{dt}, \frac{dz}{dt}\rangle
$$
$$ \frac{df(\vec{r}(t)}{dt} = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\frac{dx}{dt} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \frac{dy}{dt} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial z}\frac{dz}{dt}
$$

\subsubsection{Tangent Planes}
$$ z - f(a,b) = f_x(a,b)(x-a) + f_y(a,b)(y-b)$$

\subsubsection{Linearization}
If $\Delta x  \rightarrow 0 \text{, } \Delta y \rightarrow 0 \text{, then } \Delta z \approx dz:$
$$ \Delta z = f_x(a,b)\Delta x + f_y(a,b)\Delta y$$

\section{Multiple Integrals}

\subsection{Double Integrals Over Rectangles}

We can define a region, $R$, over which the integration will take place:
$$R = [a, b] \times [c,d] = \left \lbrace(x,y) \text{ } \epsilon \text{ } R^2 \text{ } |\text{ }  a\leq x \leq b \text{ , } c \leq y \leq d\right \rbrace $$
The \textbf{double integral} of $f$ over the rectangle $R$ is thus
$$\iint\limits_{R} f(x,y)dA = \lim_{\infty \text{, } a \to 0} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n} f(x_{ij}, y_{ij}) \Delta A$$
If $f(x,y) \geq 0$, then the double integral could be interpreted as the volume in the defined region:
$$ V = \iint\limits_{R} f(x,y)dA$$
An iterated integral is defined as 
$$\int\limits_{a}^{b} \int\limits_{c}^{d} f(x,y)dydx = \int\limits_{a}^{b}\left[ \int\limits_{c}^{d} f(x,y)dy\right]dx$$
To evaluate the above, solve the inner integral with respect to $y$ treating $x$ as a constant. Then, solve the outer integral with respect to $x$ treating $y$ as a constant.
\\
\\
\textbf{Fubini's Theorem:} States if $f$ is continuous on region $R$, then 
$$\iint\limits_{R} f(x,y)dA = \int\limits_{a}^{b} \int\limits_{c}^{d} f(x,y)dydx = \int\limits_{c}^{d} \int\limits_{a}^{b} f(x,y)dxdy$$
If $f(x,y)$ can be expressed as $g(x)h(y)$, then we can express its integration as 
$$\iint\limits_{R} f(x,y)dA = \int\limits_{a}^{b} \int\limits_{c}^{d} g(x)h(y)dydx = \int\limits_{a}^{b} g(x)dx \int\limits_{c}^{d} h(y)dy$$


\subsection{Double Integrals Over General Regions}
Double integrals do not always cover rectangular regions. They often cover general regions bounded by several functions.
\\ \\
If $f$ is integrable over $R$, then we define the double integral of $f$ over $D$ by 
$$\iint\limits_D f(x,y)dA = \iint\limits_{R} F(x,y)dA =$$
In the case that $f(x,y) \geq 0$, we can still interpret $\iint\limits_D f(x,y)dA$ as the volume of the solid that lies above $D$ and under the surface $z = f(x,y)$.
\\ \\
Similarly to rectangular regions, we can evaluate iterated integrals with functions as parameters. \\ \\ If $f$ is a continuous function such that $D = \left\lbrace (x,y)\text{ } | \text{ } a \leq x \leq b \text{, } g_1(x) \leq y \leq g_2(x) \right\rbrace$ (\textbf{Type I}), then
$$\iint\limits_{D} f(x,y)dA = \int\limits_{b}^{a} \int\limits_{g_1(x)}^{g_2(x)} f(x,y)dy dx$$
If $f$ is a continuous function such that $D = \left\lbrace (x,y)\text { } | \text{ } c \leq y \leq d \text{, } h_1(y) \leq x \leq h_2(y) \right\rbrace$ (\textbf{Type II}), then
$$\iint\limits_{D} f(x,y)dA = \int\limits_{d}^{c} \int\limits_{h_1(y)}^{h_2(y)} f(x,y)dx dy$$
If regions do not overlap, they can also be summed:
$$\iint\limits_{D} f(x,y)dA  = \iint\limits_{D_1} f(x,y)dA + \iint\limits_{D_2} f(x,y)dA $$
Finally, if we integrate the constant function $f(x,y) = 1$, we'll simply get the area of $D$. 
$$\iint\limits_{D} 1dA  = A(D)$$

\subsection{Double Integrals in Polar Coordinates}
Recall that polar coordinates $(r, \theta)$ relate to rectangular coordinates $(x,y)$ with the following equations:
$$r^2 = x^2 + y^2 \quad \quad \quad x = r\cos\theta \quad \quad \quad y = r\sin\theta$$
We can define the region $R = \left\lbrace (r,\theta)\text{ }  | \text{ } a \leq r \leq b \text{, } \alpha \leq \theta \leq \beta \right\rbrace$. If $f$ is continuous on a polar rectangle defined by this region $R$, where $ 0 \leq \beta - \alpha \leq 2\pi $, then $$\iint\limits_{R} f(x,y)dA = \int\limits_{\alpha}^{\beta} \int\limits_{a}^{b} f(r\cos\theta,r\sin\theta)\cdot rdrd\theta$$
\subsection{Applications of Double Integrals}
\subsubsection{Density and Mass}
Consider a lamina with variable density $\rho(x,y) = \lim\frac{\Delta m}{\Delta A}$. We can obtain its total mass as the limiting value of its Riemann approximation:
$$ m = \lim_{k,l \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^{l} \sum_{j=1}^{l} \rho (x_{ij}^{\star}, y_{ij}^{\star})\Delta A = \iint\limits_{D} \rho(x,y)dA  $$
\subsubsection{Moments and Center of Mass}
Consider a lamina that occupies a region $D$ and has density function $\rho (x,y)$. We can define the moments about the $x-axis$ and moments about the $y-axis$ as follows:
$$M_x = \iint\limits_{D} y\rho (x,y)dA \quad \quad \quad M_y = \iint\limits_{D} x\rho (x,y)dA$$
We can then say the coordinates of the centre of mass $(\bar x , \bar y)$ are  
$$ \bar x = \frac{M_y}{m} = \frac{1}{m}\iint\limits_{D} y\rho (x,y)dA \quad \quad \quad \bar y = \frac{M_x}{m} = \frac{1}{m}\iint\limits_{D} x\rho (x,y)dA$$
where $m$ is given by $m = \iint\limits_{D} \rho (x,y)dA$
\subsubsection{Moment of Inertia}
To find the moment of inertia about an area, the following integrals apply: 
$$I_x = \iint\limits_{D} y^2\rho (x,y)dA \quad \quad \quad I_y = \iint\limits_{D} x^2\rho (x,y)dA$$
The moment of inertia about the origin is given as 
$$ I_0 = \iint\limits_{D} (x^2 + y^2)\rho (x,y)dA$$
\subsection{Surface Area}
The area of a surface with equation $z = f(x,y)$, $(x,y) \in D$ where $f_x$ and $f_y$ are continuous , is 
$$ A(S) = \iint\limits_{D} \sqrt{[f_x(x,y)]^2 + [f_y(x,y)]^2+1} \text{ } dA $$
We can also use an alternative notation to express the same surface area function:
$$ A(S) = \iint\limits_{D} \sqrt{\left(\frac{\partial z}{\partial x}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\partial z}{\partial y}\right)^2+1} \text{ } dA $$
\subsection{Triple Integrals}
The same way that single and double integrals were defined for one variable and two variable functions, we can define triple integrals for functions of three variables. \\ \\
We can consider $f$ which is defined as a rectangular box.
$$ B = \left\lbrace (x,y,z) \text{ } | \text{ } a \leq\ x \leq b \text{, } c \leq y \leq d \text{, } r \leq z \leq s \text{ }\right\rbrace$$ The triple integral then, of $f$ over box $B$ is 
$$\iiint\limits_{R} f(x,y,z)\text{ }dA = \lim_{l \text{, } m \text{, } n \to 0} \sum_{i=1}^{l} \sum_{j=1}^{m} \sum_{k=1}^{n} f(x_{ijk}^{\star}, y_{ijk}^{\star}, z_{ijk}^{\star}) \Delta V$$
\textbf{Fubini's Theorem (For Triple Integrals):} If $f$ is continuous over the rectangular box \\ $B = [a,b] \times [c,d] \times [r,s]$, then 
$$\iiint\limits_{R} f(x,y,z)\text{ }dV = \int\limits_{r}^{s} \int\limits_{c}^{d} \int\limits_{a}^{b} f(x,y,z)\text{ }dx\text{ }dy\text{ }dz $$
The same rules for double integrals can also be applied to triple integrals
\subsubsection{Triple Integrals in Cylindrical Coordinates}
We can convert to cylindrical coordinates $(r, \theta,z)$ from rectangular coordinates $(x,y,z)$ with the following equations:
$$r^2 = x^2 + y^2 \quad \quad \quad x = rcos\theta \quad \quad \quad y = rsin\theta \quad \quad \quad z=z$$
The formula for triple integrals in cylindrical coordinates then is:
$$\iiint\limits_{R} f(x,y,z)\text{ }dV = \int\limits_{\alpha}^{\beta} \int\limits_{h_1(\theta)}^{h_2(\theta)} \int\limits_{u_1(r\cos \theta, r\sin \theta)}^{u_2(r\cos \theta, r\sin \theta)} f(r\cos \theta,r \sin \theta,z)\cdot r \text{ }dz\text{ }dr\text{ }d\theta $$
To solve for center of mass questions, apply the following formulas: $$ m =\iiint\limits_{E} \rho(x,y,z)\text{ }dV \quad \quad \quad (\bar{x}, \bar{y}, \bar{z}) = \frac{1}{V}(M_{yz}, M_{xz}, M_{xy})$$
\subsubsection{Triple Integrals in Spherical Coordinates}
The spherical coordinates  $(\rho, \theta, \phi)$ of a point P in space is where $ \rho =|OP|$ is the distance from the origin to $P$, $\theta$ is the same angle as in cylindrical coordinates, and $\phi$ is the angle between the positive z-axis and the line segment $OP$.
$$ \rho \geq 0 \quad \quad \quad 0 \leq \phi \leq \pi$$ 
We can convert from rectangular to spherical coordinates with the following equations
$$\rho^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \quad \quad \quad x = \rho\sin\phi \cos \theta \quad \quad \quad y = \rho \sin \phi\sin\theta \quad \quad \quad z=\rho \cos \theta$$
The formula for triple integrals in cylindrical coordinates then is:
$$\iiint\limits_{R} f(x,y,z)\text{ }dV = \int\limits_{c}^{d} \int\limits_{\alpha}^{\beta} \int\limits_{a}^{b} f(\rho\sin\phi \cos \theta,\rho \sin\phi \sin \theta,\rho\cos\phi)\cdot \rho^2 \sin \phi \text{ }d\rho \text{ }d\theta \text{ }d\phi $$

\subsection{Change of Variables in Multiple Integrals}
Changing integration variables in multiple integrals is a bit of different then it is in single integrals. We consider the change of variables as a transformation from the (u,v)-plane to the (x,y)-plane:
$$ T(u,v) = (x,y)$$ where $x$ and $y$ are related by the equations
$$ x = g(u,v) \quad \quad \quad y=h(u,v)$$
We can define the Jacobian of the transformation given by the above equations as 
$$\begin{vmatrix}
\frac{\partial(x,y)}{\partial(u,v)}
\end{vmatrix} = \begin{vmatrix}
\frac{\partial x}{\partial v} & \frac{\partial x}{\partial u} \\
\frac{\partial y}{\partial u} & \frac{\partial y}{\partial v}
\end{vmatrix} = \frac{\partial x}{\partial u} \frac{\partial y}{\partial v} - \frac{\partial y}{\partial u} \frac{\partial x}{\partial v}
$$
With this definition, the formula for the change of variables in double integrals then is 
$$\iint\limits_{R} f(x,y)\text{ }dA = \iint\limits_{S} f(x(u,v),y(u,v))\begin{vmatrix}
\frac{\partial(x,y)}{\partial(u,v)}
\end{vmatrix}\text{ }du \text{ } dv$$
Similarly in triple integrals, the Jacobian and change of variables are the following
$$\begin{vmatrix}
\frac{\partial(x,y,z)}{\partial(u,v,z)}
\end{vmatrix} = \begin{vmatrix}
\frac{\partial x}{\partial u} & \frac{\partial x}{\partial v} & \frac{\partial x}{\partial w}  \\
\frac{\partial y}{\partial u} & \frac{\partial y}{\partial v}  & \frac{\partial y}{\partial w}  \\
\frac{\partial z}{\partial u} & \frac{\partial z}{\partial v} & \frac{\partial z}{\partial w} 
\end{vmatrix}
$$
$$\iint\limits_{R} f(x,y,z)\text{ }dA = \iint\limits_{S} f(x(u,v,w),y(u,v,w), z(x,y,z))\begin{vmatrix}
\frac{\partial(x,y,z)}{\partial(u,v,w)}
\end{vmatrix}\text{ }du \text{ } dv \text{ } dw$$

\section{Vector Calculus}
\subsection{Line Integrals}
Line integrals are very similar to single integrals, except instead of integrating over an interval $[a,b]$, we integrate over a curve $C$. To evaluate a line integral, we can use the following formula: 
$$\int\limits_{C} f(x,y)\text{ }dA = \int\limits_{a}^{b} f(x(t),y(t)) \sqrt{\left(\frac{dx}{dt}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right)^2}\text{ } dt$$
This is called the line integral with respect to arc length. We can also evaluate a line integral with respect to $x$ and $y$ using the following formulas:
$$\int\limits_{C} f(x,y)\text{ }dx = \int\limits_{a}^{b} f(x(t),y(t))\text{ } x'(t) \text{ } dt \quad \quad \quad \int\limits_{C} f(x,y)\text{ }dy = \int\limits_{a}^{b} f(x(t),y(t)) \text{ }y'(t) \text{ } dt$$
We can also parametrize a line segment which begins at $\vec{r_0}$ and ends at $\vec{r_1}$ using a vector representation:
$$ \vec{r}(t) = (1-t)\vec{r_0} + t\vec{r_1}$$
This helps to reduce the parameters of the integral to one variable $t$.
\\ \\
Line integral apply in vector fields in important equations such as that for work. If $F$ is a continuous vector field on a smooth curve C given by vector function $\vec{r}(t)$, $a\leq t \leq b$, then the line integral of $F$ along $C$ is 
$$\int\limits_{C} F \cdot dr = \int\limits_{a}^{b} F(\vec{r}(t))\cdot r'(t) \text{ } dt = \int\limits_{C} F \cdot T \text{ }ds$$
\subsection{Fundamental Theorem for Line Integrals}
\textbf{Theorem:} Let $C$ be a smooth curve given by the vector function $\vec{r}(t)$, $a \leq t \leq b$. Let $f$ be a differentiable function of two or three variable whose gradient vector $\nabla f$ is continuous on $C$. Then
$$\int\limits_{C} \nabla f \cdot dr = f(\vec{r}(b)) - f(\vec{r}(a))$$
We can say that $\int\limits_{C} \nabla f \cdot dr$ is independent of path in $D$ if and only if $\int\limits_{C} \nabla f \cdot dr = 0$ for every closed path $C$ in D. The line integrals of conservative vector fields are independent of path.
\\ \\ 
\textbf{Theorem:} Supposing that $F$ is a vector field that is continuous on an open connected region D. If $\int\limits_{C} \nabla f \cdot dr$ is independent of path on $D$, then $F$ is a conservative vector field on $D$, meaning there exists a function $f$ such that $ \nabla f = F$
\\ \\
\textbf{Theorem:} If $F(x,y) = P(x,y)\vec{i} + Q(x,y) \vec{j}$ is a conservative vector field on, where $P$ and $Q$ have continuous first order partial derivatives on a domain $D$, then  throughout $D$:
$$ \frac{\partial P}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial Q}{\partial x}$$ 
If the above is true, then $F$ is conservative

\subsection{Green's Theorem}
\textbf{Theorem:} Let $C$ is a positively oriented, piecewise smooth, simple closed curve  in the plane and let $D$ be the region bounded by $C$. If $P$ and $Q$ have continuous partial derivatives on an open region that contains $D$, then
$$ \int\limits_{C} P\text{ }dx +Q\text{ }dy = \iint\limits_{D} \left(\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial P}{\partial y}\right) \text{ }dA$$
\subsection{Curl and Divergence}
\subsubsection{Curl}
If $F = P\vec{i} + Q\vec{j}+ R\vec{k}$ is a vector field on $R^3$ and the partial derivatives of $P$, $Q$, and $R$ all exist, then the curl of $F$ is the vector field defined by 
$$ curl\text{ } F = \left(\frac{\partial R}{\partial y} - \frac{\partial Q}{\partial z}\right) \vec{i} + \left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial z} - \frac{\partial R}{\partial x}\right) \vec{j} + \left(\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial P}{\partial y}\right) \vec{k} = \nabla \times F$$
\textbf{Theorem:} If $F$ is a function that has continuous second-order partial derivatives, then
$$ curl(\nabla F) = 0$$
This also tells us that if $F$ is a conservative vector field, the $curl \text{ } F = 0$
\\ \\
\textbf{Theorem:} If $F$ is a vector field defined on all of $R^3$, whose component functions all have continuous partial derivatives and $curl \text{ } F = 0$, then $F$ is conservative.
\subsubsection{Divergence}
If $F = P\vec{i} + Q\vec{j}+ R\vec{k}$ is a vector field on $R^3$ and $\frac{\partial P}{\partial x}$, $\frac{\partial Q}{\partial y}$, and $\frac{\partial R}{\partial z}$ all exist then the divergence of $F$ is the function of three variables defined by:
$$ div \text{ } F = \frac{\partial P}{\partial x}\vec{i} +\frac{\partial Q}{\partial y}\vec{j} + \frac{\partial R}{\partial z}\vec{k} = \nabla \cdot F$$
If $F$ is a function that has continuous second-order partial derivatives, then
$$ div \text{ } curl \text { }F  = 0$$
\subsubsection{Vector Form of Green's Theorem}
The curl and divergence operators now allow us to write Green's theorem in vector form as follows:
$$ \oint\limits_{C} F \cdot dr = \iint\limits_{D} (curl \text{ } F) \cdot k \text { } dA \quad \quad \quad  \oint\limits_{C} F \cdot n \text { } ds = \iint\limits_{D} div \text{ } F(x,y) \text { } dA$$
\subsection{Parametric Surfaces and Their Areas}
Similar to how we can define parametric functions of one variable $t$, we can describe a surface $r(u,v)$ of two parameters, $u$, and $v$, where
$$ \vec{r}(u,v) = x(u,v)\vec{i}+y(u,v)\vec{j}+z(u,v)\vec{k}$$
If a smooth parametric surface $S$ is given by the equation $\vec{r}(u,v) = x(u,v)\vec{i}+y(u,v)\vec{j}+z(u,v)\vec{k}$ and $S$ is covered just once as $(u,v)$ ranges throughout the parameter domain $D$, then the surface area of $S$ is  $$A(S) = \iint\limits_{D} | \vec{r_u} \times \vec{r_v} | \text { } dA$$ where $\vec{r_u}$ and $\vec{r_v}$ are $$\vec{r_u} = \frac{\partial x}{\partial u}\vec{i} +\frac{\partial y}{\partial u}\vec{j} + \frac{\partial z}{\partial u}\vec{k} \quad \quad \quad \vec{r_v} = \frac{\partial x}{\partial v}\vec{i} +\frac{\partial y}{\partial v}\vec{j} + \frac{\partial z}{\partial v}\vec{k}$$
\subsection{Surface Integrals}
Using the parametrized function $\vec{r}(u,v)$ from before, if the components are all non-zero and non-parallel, then the surface integral is 
$$ \iint\limits_{S} f(x,y,z) \text{ } dS = \iint\limits_{D} f(\vec{r}(u,v)) \text { }| \vec{r_u} \times \vec{r_v} | \text { } dA$$
If $F$ is continuous vector field defined by a unit normal vector $\vec{n}$, then the surface integral of $F$ over $S$ is $$ \iint\limits_{S} F \cdot ds =  \iint\limits_{S} F \cdot \vec{n} \text { } ds$$ where $\vec{n}$ is $$\frac{\vec{r_u} \times \vec{r_v}}{|\vec{r_u} \times \vec{r_v}|} $$
This is also known as the \textbf{flux} of $F$ along $S$.
\subsection{Stoke's Theorem}
Stoke's Theorem can be considered a higher order version of Green's Theorem, where it relates a surface integral over a region $S$ to a line integral around the boundary of $S$.
\\ \\ 
\textbf{Theorem:} Let $S$ be an oriented piecewise-smooth surface that is bounded by a simple, closed, piecewise boundary curve $C$ with positive orientation. Let $F$ be a vector field whose components have continuous partial derivatives on an open region in $R^3$ that contains $S$. Then $$\int\limits_{C} F \cdot dr = \iint\limits_{S} curl \text{ } F \cdot dS = \iint\limits_{S} curl \text{ } F \cdot k \text{ } dA$$

\section{Dimensional Analysis}
\subsection{Primary and Secondary Dimensions}
A dimension is a qualitative description of a physical quantity, which can either be \textbf{primary} or \textbf{secondary}. \\ \\ 
Primary dimensions are those that are not formed from a combination of other dimensions. In fluid mechanics, these are usually either $[Mass] = M$, $[Length] = L$, $[Time] = T$ or $[Force] = F$, $[Length] = L$, $[Time] = T$. \\ \\
Secondary dimensions are those that are derived from combining primary dimensions 
\subsection{Buckingham Pi Theorem}
If an equation involving $k$ variable is dimensionally homogeneous, i can be reduced to a relationship among $k-r$ independent dimensionless products ($\pi$ terms) where $r$ is the minimum number of reference dimensions required to describe the variables involved in the problem.
$$ \text{(Number of } \pi \text{ Terms)} = \text{(Number of Variables)} - \text{(Minimum Number of Reference Dimensions)} $$
To apply the Buckingham $\pi$ theorem, use the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item List all of the variables that are involved in the problem
\item Express each variable in terms of primary dimensions
\item Determine the required number of $\pi$ terms using the Buckingham $\pi$ theorem
\item Choose some repeating variables, such that the number of repeating variables is equal to the number of reference dimensions

\section{Introduction To Fluid Mechanics}
\subsection{Fluids}
A \textbf{fluid} is a substance that deforms continuously under the application of shear (tangential) force, no matter how small that force may be. A substance in liquid or gas phase is called a fluid
\subsection{Statistical vs Continuum Approach}
When studying how fluids behave, we can either explicitly account for their molecular nature, referred to as the statistical approach, or instead treat them as being continuous, referred to as the continuum approach.
\subsubsection{Statistical Approach}
We treat the fluid as a collection of molecules and the macroscopic behaviour of the fluid is determined through probability and statistics. This is not a very practical approach for modelling the behaviour of fluids in typical engineering applications.
\subsubsection{Continuum Approach}
This approach ignores individual molecules and instead treats the fluid as being continuously distributed with no holes in space. This is valid as far as the system is large relative to the space between molecules. This assumptions may not always be valid however.
\\ \\ 
The Knudsen number ($Kn$), is a dimensionless parameter that indicates when the continuum assumption is valid.
$$ Kn = \frac{\text{Microscopic Length Scale}}{\text{Macroscopic Length Scale}} << 1 \quad  \rightarrow \quad \text{Continuum Assumption Valid}$$
\subsection{Forces}
Fluids can have two types of force acting on them - \textbf{(1) Body Forces} and \textbf{(2) Surface Forces}
\subsubsection{Body Forces}
Body forces are those that develop within a fluid \underline{without} physical contact. This includes forces from gravitational and magnetic fields.
\subsubsection{Surface Forces}
Surface forces are those that are generated at the surface of a fluid element by contact with other particles or a solid surface. This can be divided into two components - \textbf{(1) normal to the area [$F_n$]} and \textbf{(2) tangent to the area [$F_t$]} Stresses come from surface forces.
\\ \\
Stress is the force per unit area obtained by dividing the surface force by the area upon which it acts. The normal stress and shear stress are shown in the following equations:
$$ \sigma = \lim_{\delta A \to 0} \frac{\delta F_n}{\delta A} \quad \quad \quad \tau = \lim_{\delta A \to 0} \frac{\delta F_t}{\delta A}$$
\subsection{Viscosity}
Viscosity is the property representing internal friction within a fluid. In fluids, it is found that the rate of deformation is directly proportional to the shear stress and the proportionality constant is the viscosity.
$$ \tau = \mu\left(\frac{d\alpha}{dt}\right) $$
Fluids where the deformation rate is linearly proportional to the shear stress are called Newtonian fluids.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Newtonian Fluids:} Water, Air, Gasoline, Oils
\item \textit{Non-Newtonian Fluids:} Blood, Plastic
\end{itemize}
The angular deformation of the element is equal to the velocity gradient giving the following relationship:
$$ \tau = \mu\left(\frac{d\alpha}{dt}\right) = \mu\left(\frac{du}{dt}\right) $$

\subsection{Compressibility}
Compressibility is classified by a property called \textbf{bulk modulus} ($E_V$)
$$ E_V = -\frac{dp}{dV/V} = \frac{\text{Differential Change in Pressure}}{\text{Fractional Change in Volume}}$$
This can also be written in terms of density rather than volume:
$$ E_V = -\frac{dp}{d\rho/\rho} = \frac{\text{Differential Change in Pressure}}{\text{Fractional Change in Density}}$$
\pagebreak

\section{Hydrostatics}
Hydrostatics considers fluids at rest or fluids moving such that there is no relative motion between adjacent particles. A fluid at rest or in rigid-body motion thus experiences zero shear stress. Since this is the case, the only surface forces present can develop from pressure. 

\subsection{Pressure}
Pressure results from molecules colliding against a surface. Every time a particle bounces off a surface, its momentum changes, since velocity changes direction. The force due to pressure always acts in a normal direction to the surface. Pressure is a normal stress and is inward acting normal force per unit area. The force on one side of a small element of surface $dA$ due to pressure is 
$$ d\vec{F_n} = -P\text{ } dA \cdot \vec{n} $$
The pressure at a point in a fluid at rest, or in motion, is independent of direction as long as there are no shearing stresses present. This is known as \textbf{Pascal's Law}.
\subsubsection{Equations for A Pressure Field}
The resultant surface force acting on an element can be expressed in vector form as 
$$ \sum \delta F_s = - \left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial x} \vec{i} + \frac{\partial P}{\partial y} \vec{j} + \frac{\partial P}{\partial z} \vec{k}\right) \text{ }\delta x \text{ }\delta y \text{ }\delta z $$
Thus the resultant pressure force per unit volume is 
$$\frac{\sum \delta F_s}{\text{ }\delta x \text{ }\delta y \text{ }\delta z} = - \vec{\nabla} P$$
The total body force comes through the weight of the element:
$$ \sum \delta F_b = - \rho g \text{ }\delta x \text{ }\delta y \text{ }\delta z \text{ } \vec{k} $$
And the total body force per unit volume is
$$\frac{\sum \delta F_b}{\text{ }\delta x \text{ }\delta y \text{ }\delta z} = - \rho g \text{ } \vec{k} $$
From these equations, we can derive the general equation of motion for a fluid with no shearing stresses:
$$ - \vec{\nabla} P - \rho g \vec{k} = \rho \vec{a} $$
\subsubsection{Fluids at Rest}
For a fluid at rest ($\vec{a}=0$) we have that 
$$ \vec{\nabla} P = - \rho g \vec{k}$$
This shows us that the pressure does not depend on $x$ or $y$ and is constant to the direction of gravity. Therefore,
$$ \frac{\partial P}{\partial z} = -\rho g = \gamma $$
A fluid with a constant density is considered an \textbf{incompressible} fluid. Through integration, we obtain
$$ P_1 - P_2 = \rho g (z_2 - z_1) = \rho g h$$
which tells us that in an incompressible fluid at rest, the pressure increases linearly with depth in a gravity field and does not change in the horizontal direction.
\\ \\
On the other hand, we consider gases such as oxygen, nitrogen, and air as \textbf{compressible} fluids since the density can change with pressure and temperature changes. By applying the ideal gas law in isothermal conditions, we get that
$$ P_2 = P_1 \exp{\left(-\frac{g(z_2 - z_1)}{RT_o}\right)}$$
\subsubsection{Measurement of Pressure}
Pressure values must be stated with respect to a reference level. The pressure is given as either absolute pressure or gauge pressure.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Absolute Pressure:} Pressure value measured referencing a perfect vacuum (absolute zero pressure)
\item \textit{Gauge Pressure:} Pressure value measured relative to the local atmospheric pressure
\end{itemize}
To convert between the two, we use the following relationship
$$ P_{abs} = P_{atm} + P_{gauge}$$
\subsubsection{Instruments for Measuring Pressure}
\begin{itemize}
\item Manometers
\item Bourdon Pressure Gauge
\item Transducers
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Hydrostatic Forces on Submerged Surfaces}
When a surface is submerged in a fluid, forces develop on the surface due to the fluid. For fluids at rest, the force must be perpendicular to the surface since there are no shearing stresses present. The pressure will also vary linearly with depth if the fluid is incompressible. the differential force on a differential area $dA$ of a submerged surface is 
$$ d\vec{F_p} = -p\text{ } dA \text{ } \vec{n} = -p \text{ } dA $$
The total pressure force on an area can be obtained by integrating the differential force over the area
$$\vec{F_R} = \iint\limits_{A} d\vec{F}$$

\subsubsection{Method 3: Pressure Prism Concept}
\subsection{Buoyancy}
Objects feel lighter and weigh less in a liquid than in air. This suggests that a fluid exerts an upward force on a body immersed in it. This is called the buoyant force and is denoted as $F_B$. This is caused by the increase of pressure in a fluid with depth. We conclude that the buoyant force acting on an object is equal to the weight of the liquid displaced by the solid body. 
$$ F_P = \rho g V \vec{k} $$
This is known as \textbf{Archimedes's Principle}. Note that the buoyant force acts upward, and it is independent of the density of the solid body
$$ \frac{V_{sub}}{V_{total}} = \frac{\rho_{body}}{\rho_{fluid}}$$
\subsubsection{Stability of Immersed and Floating Bodies}
The stability of a body can be determined by considering what happens when it is displaced from its equilibrium position.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Stable Equilibrium:} Any small disturbance generates a restoring force to return to initial equilibrium position
\item \textit{Neutral Equilibrium:} If equilibrium is disturbed, the body will stay at the new position 
\item \textit{Unstable Equilibrium:} Any disturbance, even infinitesimal, will prevent the body from returning to equilibrium 
\end{itemize}
For completely submerged bodies:
\begin{itemize}
\item If the center of gravity is below the center of buoyancy, the object is bottom heavy, and is stable
\item If the center of gravity is below the center of buoyancy, the object is top-heavy, and is unstable
\end{itemize}
